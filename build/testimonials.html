                  "I moved to the Quakertown area 6 months ago from New York City. Over the years, I have been a member of some of the top gyms in NYC and have had a number of personal trainers. After relocating, I thought I might have a difficult time finding a new trainer of the caliber I was accustomed to. Luckily I ran into Jesse. He is fantastic! He brings enthusiasm and creativity to each workout and is knowledgeable, motivating and professional. Jesse receives my highest recommendation and you’ll be lucky to have him as your trainer."

                  "My philosophy has always been “I’ll work out when I need to,” secretly hoping I would never have to. After 2 kids and reaching my 30’s, I finally came to the point where I had to do something. I tried running and going to the gym, but like most, found reasons why I couldn’t fit it into my schedule. I started working out with Jesse and instantly loved it! He is very reliable and makes every workout completely different, which has kept me interested in continuing to work out for the past 2 years. There have been noticeable differences in my body shape and I’ve gotten numerous compliments from people I see every day that they notice the difference from when I started working out. I would definitely recommend Jesse to anyone who was looking to start or restart working out, regardless of skill level."
